## Key Concepts for AI Infrastructure

### 1. Automation is Critical

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automate ML model deployment
set -euo pipefail

MODEL_PATH="/models/classifier_v1.pkl"
DEPLOY_DIR="/opt/ml/models"

# Validate model
if [[ ! -f "$MODEL_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Model not found at $MODEL_PATH"
    exit 1
fi

# Deploy with permissions
sudo cp "$MODEL_PATH" "$DEPLOY_DIR/"
sudo chown ml-user:ml-group "$DEPLOY_DIR/$(basename $MODEL_PATH)"
sudo chmod 644 "$DEPLOY_DIR/$(basename $MODEL_PATH)"

echo "Model deployed successfully"
```

### 2. Monitoring System Resources

```bash
# Monitor GPU usage for ML workloads
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Check memory usage
free -h
vmstat 1 10

# Disk I/O for training jobs
iostat -x 1 10

# Process monitoring
top -u ml-user
htop
```

### 3. Secure Remote Access

```bash
# Configure SSH for secure access
cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<EOF
Host ml-server
    HostName 10.0.1.50
    User ml-admin
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ml-server-key
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
EOF

# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/ml-server-key
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config
```

### 4. Log Management

```bash
# View training logs
tail -f /var/log/ml/training.log

# Search for errors
grep -i error /var/log/ml/*.log

# Compress old logs
find /var/log/ml -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -exec gzip {} \;
```

## Essential Commands Reference

### File Operations
```bash
ls -lah              # List files with details
cd /path/to/dir      # Change directory
pwd                  # Print working directory
cp source dest       # Copy files
mv source dest       # Move/rename files
rm -rf dir/          # Remove directory recursively
mkdir -p path/to/dir # Create directory with parents
touch file.txt       # Create empty file
cat file.txt         # Display file contents
less file.txt        # Paginated file viewer
head -n 10 file      # First 10 lines

```

### Text Processing
```bash
grep "pattern" file  # Search for pattern
grep -r "text" dir/  # Recursive search
sed 's/old/new/g'    # Replace text
awk '{print $1}'     # Print first column
cut -d',' -f1        # Cut by delimiter

uniq                 # Remove duplicates
wc -l file           # Count lines
```

### Process Management
```bash
ps aux               # List all processes
top                  # Interactive process monitor
htop                 # Better process monitor
kill PID             # Terminate process
kill -9 PID          # Force kill
killall name         # Kill by name
bg                   # Background job
fg                   # Foreground job
nohup cmd &          # Run detached from terminal
```

### System Information
```bash
uname -a             # System information
df -h                # Disk space
du -sh dir/          # Directory size
free -h              # Memory usage
uptime               # System uptime
who                  # Logged in users
last                 # Login history
```

### Networking

## Best Practices

### 1. Script Safety

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Always include these at the top
set -euo pipefail

# -e: Exit on error
# -u: Exit on undefined variable
# -o pipefail: Catch errors in pipelines
```

### 2. Use Functions

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define functions for reusability
check_requirements() {
    local cmd="$1"
    if ! command -v "$cmd" &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Error: $cmd is not installed"
        return 1
    fi
}

deploy_model() {
    local model_path="$1"
    local deploy_dir="$2"

    check_requirements "python3" || exit 1

    # Deployment logic here
    echo "Deploying $model_path to $deploy_dir"
}

# Main
deploy_model "/models/model.pkl" "/opt/ml"
```

### 3. Error Handling

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if ! some_command; then
    echo "Command failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Or with error handling
if ! some_command 2>/tmp/error.log; then
    echo "Error occurred. See /tmp/error.log"
    cat /tmp/error.log
    exit 1
fi
```

### 4. Logging

```bash
#!/bin/bash

LOG_FILE="/var/log/deployment.log"

log() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $*" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
}

log "Starting deployment"
deploy_model
log "Deployment complete"
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Not Quoting Variables

```bash
# Bad - will break with spaces
file=$1
cat $file

# Good - always quote
file="$1"
cat "$file"
```

### 2. Not Checking Exit Codes

```bash
# Bad - continues even on error
command
do_something_else

# Good - check exit code
if ! command; then
    echo "Command failed"
    exit 1
fi
do_something_else
```

### 3. Using Root Unnecessarily

```bash
# Bad - runs everything as root
sudo bash script.sh

# Good - use sudo only when needed
#!/bin/bash
normal_command
sudo privileged_command
normal_command_2
```
