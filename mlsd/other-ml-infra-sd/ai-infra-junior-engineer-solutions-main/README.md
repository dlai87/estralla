Reference solutions for every exercise and project in the [Junior AI Infrastructure Engineer learning path](https://github.com/ai-infra-curriculum/ai-infra-junior-engineer-learning). This repository is structured to **mirror the learning repo's curriculum 1:1** — same module numbers, same topic ordering — so you can compare your work side-by-side.

> **Learning philosophy:** Attempt each exercise in the learning repo first. Only consult these solutions after a genuine attempt. The point is to compare *your approach* to a reference, not to copy code.

## What's New — 2026-05-27

- All TODO-laden Python scaffolds across projects 02-05 replaced with working reference implementations. Each project's `src/` and `tests/` are now real, runnable code:
  - **Project 02 (Kubernetes serving)**: `app.py` (Flask + Prometheus + K8s liveness/readiness probes + SIGTERM graceful shutdown), new `model.py` (deterministic stand-in `ModelLoader`), `tests/test_k8s.py` (full kubernetes-client integration tests, auto-skip when cluster unreachable).
  - **Project 03 (ML pipeline)**: end-to-end Airflow DAG with XCom flow + kill-fast validation + MLflow registry staging, plus full pytest suite for ingestion / preprocessing / MLflow tracker / DAG shape.
  - **Project 04 (Monitoring)**: full Prometheus instrumentation + ML-specific drift detection (KS / PSI / JS), performance monitor, confidence analyzer with calibration, data-quality monitor.
  - **Project 05 (Production capstone)**: integrated Flask + Prometheus + MLflow `ModelManager` with API-key auth + image validation; full e2e test suite that auto-skips when `API_URL` unreachable.
  - **Supplementary multi-cloud capstone**: real cross-cloud e2e checks (sync, failover, latency SLO, DR) configured via `MULTI_CLOUD_API_URLS`.
- New `.github/workflows/runtime-validation.yml` adds `kubectl apply --dry-run`, `terraform validate`, and `docker buildx` smoke gates across `projects/` and `modules/`.
- Audit score: 52 → 62.

## What's New — May 2026

The repository was restructured to align module numbering with the canonical curriculum (`CURRICULUM.md`). Highlights:

- ✅ **Modules renamed to match learning curriculum**: `mod-001-python-fundamentals`, `mod-002-linux-essentials`, `mod-003-git-version-control`, `mod-007-apis-web-services`, `mod-009-monitoring-basics`, `mod-010-cloud-platforms` — same names as in learning.
- ✅ **New `mod-008-databases-sql`** with 5 exercise solutions (CRUD, ML registry design, advanced SQL, SQLAlchemy ORM, indexing & optimization).
- ✅ **New Flask exercise** (`mod-007/exercise-05-flask-framework`) to complement the existing FastAPI exercise.
- ✅ **Project 02-05 solutions** are now real code — previously they were markdown stubs only. Includes Helm chart, Grafana dashboards, Locust load tests, DVC pipeline, Great Expectations suite, Alertmanager + runbooks, Terraform modules, Velero config.
- ✅ **Orphan and duplicate modules cleaned up**: `mod-010-cloud-platforms` orphan merged; `mod-007-cicd-basics` moved to `supplementary/` (no learning curriculum slot); alternative capstones moved to `supplementary/alternative-capstones/`.
- ✅ **`mod-000-orientation`** holds pre-curriculum onboarding (AI infra overview, dev environment setup) — supplements but does not duplicate any learning module.

## Quick Start

Each module has its own README explaining how to run the exercises. Common prerequisites:

```bash
# Tools
brew install python@3.11 docker kubectl helm terraform aws-cli

# Per-exercise setup is usually:
cd modules/mod-001-python-fundamentals/exercise-01-python-basics
pip install -r requirements.txt        # if present
pytest tests/                          # to validate
```

For database exercises:

```bash
docker run -d --name junior-db \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpass \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=ml \
    -p 5432:5432 postgres:15
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:devpass@localhost:5432/ml
```

For project solutions, see each project's `README.md` and `SOLUTION_GUIDE.md`.

## How to Use This Repository

### For Learners

1. **Attempt first.** Open the [learning repo exercise](https://github.com/ai-infra-curriculum/ai-infra-junior-engineer-learning) and complete it without looking here.
2. **Compare second.** Look at the matching solution here. Note *where your approach differs* — not just whether you "got it right."
3. **Read the why.** Solutions include inline comments and `SOLUTION_GUIDE.md` files that explain the trade-offs. The decisions are the lesson, not the code.
4. **Run the tests.** Every solution that ships with tests should pass `pytest tests/`. If yours doesn't, that's a starting point.

### For Instructors

- Use as reference implementations for grading.
- Adapt the `TEMPLATES/` for new exercises in your variant.
- The `SOLUTION_GUIDE.md` per project is a teach-able walkthrough.

### For Reviewers

- Open issues against specific exercise solutions if you find bugs or improvements.
- PRs welcome — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

| `modules/mod-001-foundations/exercise-03-version-control`   | `modules/mod-003-git-version-control/exercise-01-git-fundamentals` |
| `modules/mod-002-python-programming/*`                       | `modules/mod-001-python-fundamentals/*` |
| `modules/mod-003-linux-command-line/*`                       | `modules/mod-002-linux-essentials/*` |
| `modules/mod-005-docker-containerization/*`                  | `modules/mod-005-docker-containers/*` |
| `modules/mod-008-cloud-platforms/*` + orphan `mod-010-cloud-platforms/*` | `modules/mod-010-cloud-platforms/*` |
| `modules/mod-009-monitoring-logging/*`                       | `modules/mod-009-monitoring-basics/*` |
| `modules/mod-011-ml-serving-apis/*`                          | `modules/mod-007-apis-web-services/*` |
| `modules/mod-007-cicd-basics/*` (no curriculum slot)         | `supplementary/cicd-basics/*` |
| `modules/mod-010-capstone-projects/*` (alt variants)         | `supplementary/alternative-capstones/*` |
